# Hi, I'm Konstantin 👋

I am a scientist, developer, and engineer with genuine interest in software and how things work.

My main areas of expertise include: 
* embedded systems, 
* sensors and algorithms, 
* eye-tracking,
* camera, 
* media formats,
* communication protocols, and
* data pipelines,
* the transformation of raw data to information.

In the past I also worked with automotive ECU development, robotics, 3-D perception, and FPGAs.
