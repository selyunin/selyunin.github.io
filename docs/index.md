# Hi, I'm Konstantin Selyunin

I am a tech person with genuine interest in software and how things work.

My main areas of expertise include: 
* embedded systems, 
* sensors and algorithms, 
* eye-tracking,
* camera, 
* media formats,
* communication protocols, and 
* the transformation of raw data to information.

I previously worked with automotive ECU development, robotics, 3-D perception, and FPGAs.
