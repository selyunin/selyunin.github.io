# Music

Writing an arrangement or a sheet music for accordion has its own peculiarities, 
especially when dealing with the left hand (bass). 

If you are a music enthusiast, engraving your piece in [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/),
a free and open-source music notation software, is advantageous for various reasons. 
Lilypond not only delivers great printouts, but also allows producing MIDI files. 
I have created a github repository, which you can use as a starting point for typesetting your own accordion music:
